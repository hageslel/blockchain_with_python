### Project Objective

This objective of this project is to leverage Python alongside blockchain technology to transact on crypto wallets.  In this project specifically, Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin Testnet (BTCTEST) wallets were utilized.  Numerous functions were defined to assist in deriiving wallets, converting private keys to account addresses, and create and send transactions for each account.  The Python Bit and Web3 libraries were leveraged to accomplish these tasks. 


Create a README.md that contains the test transaction screenshots, as well as the code used to send them.
Pair the screenshot with the line(s) of code.


Write a short description about what the wallet does, what is is built with, and how to use it.


Include installing pip dependencies using requirements.txt, as well as cloning and installing hd-wallet-derive.
You may include the hd-wallet-derive folder in your repo, but still include the install instructions. You do not
need to include Python or PHP installation instructions.
